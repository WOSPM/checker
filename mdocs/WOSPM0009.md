## Rationale

README document is the first place that user faces before using your project or contributing to it. You should create as it is ablog post or article describing your project simply. The 200 is arguable.

The word count is calculated by;

- Removing the newline, "-", "#" and "|" characters
- Removing HTML comments
- Removing code block
- Removing image markdown
- Replacing link markdown with the text of the link
