## Rationale

Open source projects long last with the help of contributors. Even if you do not have any contributors yet, putting a `contributors` section will show your approach to the public. If you do not prefer to put a section on README (because of big number of contributors, etc.), a link to the contributors list will be also ok.

> Be nice with people that helped you! Some open source projects like gatsby reward contributors with goodies. If you can't afford that, do a public post (on twitter or other platforms) about the contribution and mention the author (here is an example of public thanks). Open a Contributors section in your README to publicly thank them or showcase them on your project documentation or website.
