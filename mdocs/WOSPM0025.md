## Rationale

A changelog is a file which contains a chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project to make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release. 

A changelog should be displayed to users out of the context of the version control service (GitHub, Gitlab etc.).
