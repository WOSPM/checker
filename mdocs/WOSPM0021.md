## Rationale

Being responsive when someone files an issue, submits a pull request, or asks a question about your project helps people to be more enthusiastic about participating. According to the [Open Source Survey 2017](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) by Github, 80 percent of the people thinks that unresponsiveness is a problem encountered in open source.

WOSPM/Checker checks if:
- Any maintainer or owner of the project should respond to any issue in 24 hours.

> Even if you can’t review the request immediately, acknowledging it early helps increase engagement.
